remOcular provides a AJAX web interface to Unix command line tools like
traceroute, top, mpstat, ...  The tools are integrated via a plug-in
interface.  remOcular comes with plugins for

 * top - process list
 * mpstat - processors related statistics
 * traceroute - packets trace to network host
 * df - disk free

 ... and many more

remOcular can be easily enhanced to support additional tools.  All it takes
is a plugin module (written in perl) on the server side.

See http://www.remocular.org for more information

INSTALLATION
------------

You can use the installer.sh script to setup remOcular

 ./installer.sh /opt/remocular

This will place the server part of the installation into
/opt/remocular. Remocular requires a few extra perl modules to run:
Mojlicious, Config::Grammar and IPC::Run.  The installer will check if the
modules are present on your system.  If not, it will download them and
install a LOCAL-COPY into /opt/remocular

* The installer does NOT modify any files on your system. 
* All installation happens in /opt/remocular
* The installer can be run as a normal user as long as it can write
  into the installation directoreis.

The remOcular backend server can run in a wide variety of ways: FastCGI,
mod_perl, psgi and CGI.  RemOcular also has a built in webserver so that it
can run standalone.

Once the installer has completed its task it will show some additional
installation information.
to you.

DEVELOPEMENT
------------

remOcular is written in Perl for the server side and JavaScript for the
browser part.  The beautiful GUI is thanks to to wonderful qooxdoo toolkit. 
See www.qooxdoo.org for more information.

If you want to enhance remOcular with additional plugins, you only have to
change the server side.  No JavaScript programming is required.  See the
existing plugins for inspiration and add the new plugin to the remocular.cfg
file.  There is also a plugin testing tool in the bin directory to help you
test plugins without going through the webserver.
